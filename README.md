# cdncss beta

Due to the success of [cdnjs.com](http://cdnjs.com), we are currently trialling a content distribution network for reusable CSS snippets.

Like [cdnjs.com](http://cdnjs.com) we would like to continue the community supported repository and welcome you to fork this repository or create issues for CSS snippets you believe should be hosted on a CDN.

We will react accordingly to the communities response and if positive, negotiate with [CloudFlare.com](http://cloudflare.com) to send the repository live.

Please contribute if you find that a un-missable library is missing.

## Fork Instructions
Normalize.css has been added to the repository as an example for anyone wanting to add their own or suggested CSS snippets.

If the CSS library in question has no versioning use "0" for now.

Only un-minified versions for now.
